## Getting started with the Project

To make it easy for you to get started with our project, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Start off by cloning the project onto your personal computer(You will need to have anaconda installed):
1. Open your terminal
2. Move to the file in which you want the project to be saved in (using 'cd _foldername_')
or Make your folder ('mkdir _foldername_') then move into it the newly created folder
3. Once in the file, copy and paste the following link and press enter:
git clone git@github.com:LethaboMokg/meta_devs.git
4. You now have access to edit and update the code on jupyter notebook

## Before pushing anything to the repository:
1. Open your terminal and move to folder in which the code is saved
2. In the terminal, enter the following commands:
		- git status
			(allows us to see the saved and unsaved commits)
		- git pull
			(pulls any changes recently added by someone else in the group / updates your git)
		- git add .
			(adds all the classes and changes you've created/ changed)
		- git add _filename_
			(adds a specific file or class within the code you're pushing)
		- git commit -m "_whatever name you want to commit_"
			(commits the changes with specified name)
		- git push .
			(pushes everything you have just added and commited)
			  
4. You now have officially pushed something to git

## Description
In this project we are building a model that sources and analyses information from students to find their preffered learning techniques and other contributing factors that have an effect in sparking their interest in enrolling into the STEM subjects. Results from the model will be the feedback given specifically to teachers, to help them better the quality of their lessons, thus increasing the number of students into the STEM subjects.
